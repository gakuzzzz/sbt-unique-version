This is the initial release of sbt-unique-version.

Usage
-----

Add the following in  your `build.sbt`:

    import UniqueVersionKeys._ // put this at the top

    uniqueVersionSettings

    uniqueVersion := true

Set the `version` to a snapshot one such as `"0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"`.
This would substitute the artifact revision to something like `"0.1.0-20120602-065305"`.

Your user can then point to it as `"0.1.0-+"`.
